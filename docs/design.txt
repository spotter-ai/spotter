Design specs for the agent

Modes:
 - "Plan": attempt to plan (return frontier states if planning fails
 - "Learn": Given frontier states, discover options
 - "Update": domain model after a few iterations

  - "Execute":
        - high level actions
        - low level actions

  - "Detect"

Reasoner:
    - * focused mode: plan
    - learning mode: hypothesize things to assist with targeted exploration

Discoverer:
    - focused mode: executing options
    - * defocused mode: learning options

maybe discoverer and executor are the same thing -- maybe



Agent steps
1. Receives goal
2. Prepares task by querying environment, and formulating task
3. Run search + exploration

Basic skills:


1. Prepare task
    - Get initial condition by
        - looking at domain file
        - getting detectors
        - reading


Detectors

detectors = Detectors()
detectors.activate(

empty = EmptyDetector()
